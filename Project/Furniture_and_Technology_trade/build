Project: Furniture and Technology Trade Analysis using Hadoop, Spark, and Hive
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze trade data for furniture and technology products sourced from global stores and suppliers. By leveraging big data technologies, the project focuses on deriving actionable insights to optimize supply chain operations, boost revenue, and enhance customer satisfaction. The project integrates modern tools like Hadoop, Spark, and Hive to process and analyze data efficiently.

Technologies Used
Hadoop:

Distributed storage using HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) ensures scalability and fault tolerance.
Batch processing of large datasets for managing the data ingestion pipeline.
Apache Spark:

Fast and distributed data processing framework.
Performs advanced analytics, machine learning, and real-time data processing.
Apache Hive:

SQL-like querying on data stored in HDFS.
Simplifies data aggregation and reporting by enabling a familiar SQL interface.
Specific Objectives
1. Data Integration and Management
Data Collection:

Collect data from multiple sources such as:
Sales Transactions: Daily/weekly/monthly sales data of furniture and technology products.
Inventory: Stock levels, restocking history, and warehouse data.
Customer Feedback: Sentiment analysis data from reviews, surveys, and social media.
Supplier Information: Delivery schedules, pricing trends, and reliability metrics.
Data Storage:

Utilize Hadoop's HDFS for storing large-scale data securely.
Ensure fault tolerance and scalability for increasing data volumes.
Implement proper file formats like Parquet or ORC for efficient querying.
ETL Pipeline:

Extract data from structured, semi-structured, and unstructured sources.
Transform and clean the data using Spark, ensuring it is consistent and ready for analysis.
Load the processed data into HDFS for downstream processing.
2. Data Analysis
Sales Trend Analysis:

Identify high-performing and low-performing products.
Compare sales trends across regions, categories, and time periods (e.g., holidays, weekdays vs. weekends).
Regional Performance:

Assess profitability and growth rates for each region to identify expansion opportunities.
Evaluate the impact of localized marketing campaigns.
Demand Forecasting:

Use historical sales data to predict future demand patterns for furniture and technology products.
Optimize inventory levels by region and season.
Customer Insights:

Analyze customer feedback to identify product quality issues or feature requests.
Segment customers based on purchasing behavior for personalized marketing.
3. Reporting and Visualization
Data Presentation:

Generate tables, graphs, and charts using Hive queries and external tools like Tableau or Power BI.
Focus on:
Revenue breakdown by product category (e.g., furniture, laptops, smartphones).
Year-over-year growth rates and seasonal trends.
Correlation between inventory levels and sales performance.
Visualization Objectives:

Provide interactive dashboards for executives to monitor performance metrics in real-time.
Create heatmaps for regional sales distribution.
Present time-series forecasts of demand and revenue.
Deliverables
Data Pipeline:
Complete ETL pipeline to collect, clean, and store data in HDFS.
Analysis Results:
Detailed reports on sales trends, demand forecasts, and regional performance.
Dashboards:
Interactive and visually appealing dashboards for presenting insights to stakeholders.
Potential Challenges
Handling data from diverse sources with varying formats and quality.
